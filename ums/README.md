# University Musical Society (UMS) Marketing Project

**Can we predict the future ticket purchases of UMS customers?**

The Michigan Data Science Team (MDST) and the University Musical
Society (UMS) have partnered on a project that will begin at the end
of Winter 2016 and continue into the Spring/Summer terms. UMS has
graciously provided us with **5 years of anonymized purchase data**
from concert-goers at the University of Michigan. Our goals are both
exploratory -- *what patterns and trends can we discover in ticket
purchase data?* -- as well as predictive -- *how can we leverage these
discoveries to predict future purchases?

Prizes: TBD
