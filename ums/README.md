# UMS Marketing Project

**_Can we predict the future ticket purchases of UMS customers?_**

The University Musical Society (UMS) has graciously provided us with
**5 years of anonymized purchase data** from concert-goers at the
University of Michigan. From these five years, we have records of
**over 190,000 transactions from 48,000 users**, totalling over **$13M
in revenue.** Our goals are both exploratory (*what patterns and
trends can we discover in ticket purchase data?*), as well as
predictive (*how can we leverage these discoveries to predict future
purchases?*).

This project will kick off near the end of Winter semester and
continue into the Spring and Summer terms.
